
## Project Overview

### Idea

 Developed a platform to enable citizens to upload the names of unused medicines, facilitating their collection and redistribution to those in need. This application aims to reduce medical wastage in India by providing an efficient communication channel between citizens and NGOs, thereby cutting down on medicine demand and costs.

### Background

India faces significant challenges related to medicine waste. Between June 2020 and June 2021, India generated 56,898 tonnes of Covid-19 biomedical waste. As medicine costs rise, not everyone can afford them. Rather than discarding unused medicines, our platform allows for their redistribution (if not expired) to those in need. Many NGOs carry out such tasks, but citizens are often unaware, and NGOs lack a systematic method for collecting and redistributing medicines.

### Sign-In/Sign-Up Page

The Sign-Up page offers two options: Donor and NGO, directing users to the respective pages. This ensures a tailored user experience based on the user's role.

### Donor Page

The Donor page consists of two sections:

1. **Incentive Section**: Engages and motivates users to donate medicines by highlighting their stats and the positive impact of their contributions.
2. **Form Section**: Collects details of the medicine the donor wishes to donate.


### NGO Page

The NGO page features a search section where NGOs can find the medicines they need and arrange for collection from users. 

## Backend

Backend includes:
- **Database Schema**: Designed for users and medicines, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **API Routes**: Implemented for login, registration, donor form submission, and other essential functionalities.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express**: For building the server and handling API requests.
- **MongoDB**: For database management.
